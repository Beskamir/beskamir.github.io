# P1: User Research

## Project Idea: Garden guide (e.g. planning, managing and tracking a garden)

The objective of our project is to create a gardening guide program. More specifically, a mobile application, and potentially other systems further down the line. The gardening guide should be able to assist in planning, managing, maintaining and tracking a given garden. As such, we expect the program to be used for any combination of those objectives by a gardener with variable experience and background. Thus, the age group, technological abilities, physical and mental abilities, and gender vary quite a bit in our expected users. However, we expect most of our users to not be technological experts. Since gardening is typically a home hobby, the context under which we expect our application to be used in is a relatively calm and relaxed home setting. 

## Stakeholders and Users

|Stakeholders|Description|
| --- | --- |
|Investors|Investors are those who finance and believe in our product. They are likely to have prior business experience involving the marketing and likely the development of software (mobile applications, etc.). Investors classify as stakeholders because they are directly impacted by the success of our product. More specifically, they are financially bound to our products success.|
|Users of application|The users are those who will use the product for gardening related purposes (i.e. to manage a garden). Experience is variable, but users most likely have some basic knowledge regarding gardening and technology. Users classify as stakeholders because they directly make use of our product to benefit them.|
|Developers|The developers design and program the software that is utilized by the application. Most likely are software engineers or computer scientists and are familiar with software development. Developers classify as stakeholders because they work on the application and are dependent on its financial success.|
|Sales people (marketing)|The sales people consist of those who sell and market the product to the users and investors. Sales people most likely have a strong background in marketing/sales. Sales people are stakeholders because they are dependent on the product’s financial success.|
|General Employees|The general employees consist of anyone who is an employee of the company that is developing the product. General employee experience varies wildly depending on department and background. General employees classify as stakeholders because they are dependent on the products and consequently the company’s financial success.|


## User Research Methods

####The research methods we used during our user research are:
 - Interviews
 - Survey
 - Secondary Research 
 

## User Research Method 1: Interview

### __Justification__:
Interviews are highly informative and easy to carry out. Interviews are also good at obtaining primary data from users of our product. Interviews are good at ascertaining what a user wants and expects from the product. 

---

### __Method Description:__
In total we interviewed 4 individuals that we considered to be a relatively decent representation of our target audience. We sat down with them for a couple minutes asking our questions and summarizing their responses directly in the document containing those questions. While all of those questions and the summarized responses are included in this document; we did not update the questions with any of the clarification or prompting that was sometimes needed during the interviews. 

---

### **Summary of Findings:** 
  - Our interviewees mainly keep track of their garden by memory or visual assessment although one of them uses a calendar.
  - A common issue seems to be finding the time to do gardening.
  - A common goal is to be able to see the results of their work. As in all their plants survive and look great.
  - The participants seemed to be at least somewhat familiar with technology.
  - Interviewees were confused by some of the questions and required clarification. This was particularly problematic as we didn’t want to influence our interviewees answers.

## User Research Method 2: Survey

### __Justification__:
Surveys are good at identifying particular characteristics and perceptions of users that will use our product. This especially an quick way to obtain answers from a large cohort of individuals.

---

### **Method Description:** 
The survey we created consisted of 10 questions and none of them were required to be filled out by the participant. Meaning that they basically filled out whatever they wanted rather than having to invent some answer for a question they would have preferred to have left blank. The survey consisted of mainly closed questions so that we could have a more qualitative analysis of the results. Also since closed questions take less time than open questions to answer this was done with consideration of the participants as well. We posted the survey on [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com) and then shared the [link to it](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/BKSFF79) on social media. That resulted in 12 responses to our survey.

---

### **Summary of Findings:** 
 - Pretty much all the participants grow some kind of edible plants in their gardens. Indicating that some kind of harvest tracking should be a high priority feature.<details>
<summary>__Survey Question 1__ _(click to expand)_:</summary><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q1.PNG" alt="Survey Question 1" style="width: 512px;"/>
<summary> </summary>
</details>

 - Most people seem to spend less than 3 hours on gardening per week, at least on average. This may be related to the "lack of time" responses we got during the interviews.<details>
<summary>__Survey Question 2__ _(click to expand)_:</summary><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q2.PNG" alt="Survey Question 2" style="width: 512px;"/>
<summary> </summary>
</details>

 - Exactly half of our participants are the only person involved in maintaining their garden. Thus to accommodate the other half we should consider making our application so that it can deal with multiple users working on the same garden.<details>
<summary>__Survey Question 3__ _(click to expand)_:</summary><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q3.PNG" alt="Survey Question 3" style="width: 512px;"/>
<summary> </summary>
</details>

 - People tend to either water plants on a fixed schedule or only wait a few days for rainfall. What's interesting is that there are rules about watering plants in Australia and it's unlikely that they are the only country with gardening related laws. Thus as a thought we could consider adding functionality which informs the user of their country's laws and tries to ensure that they don't break them.<details>
<summary>__Survey Question 4__ _(click to expand)_:</summary><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q4.PNG" alt="Survey Question 4" style="width: 512px;"/>
<summary> </summary>
</details>

 - Most participants seem to get a decent amount of rainfall so we should certainly consider rainfall when designing the watering/maintaining section of our application.<details>
<summary>__Survey Question 5__ _(click to expand)_:</summary><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q5a.PNG" alt="Survey Question 5a" style="width: 512px;"/> 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q5b.PNG" alt="Survey Question 5b" style="width: 512px;"/>
<summary> </summary>
</details>

 - Most participants would consider using an application for managing their garden so, unless they are just trying to appease us by answering what they think we want to hear, our application wouldn't be completely useless.<details>
<summary>__Survey Question 6__ _(click to expand)_:</summary><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q6.PNG" alt="Survey Question 6" style="width: 512px;"/>
<summary> </summary>
</details>

 - Despite tools for planning/setting up a garden winning by first past the post standards, tools for maintaining/managing a garden seem to be  more desired. <details>
<summary>__Survey Question 7__ _(click to expand)_:</summary><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q7.PNG" alt="Survey Question 7" style="width: 512px;"/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q7a.PNG" alt="Survey Question 7a" style="width: 512px;"/>
<summary> </summary>
</details>

 - Question 8 had a bunch of cool ideas we hadn't considered yet such as succession planting or companion plant suggestions.<details>
<summary>__Survey Question 8__ _(click to expand)_:</summary><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q8a.PNG" alt="Survey Question 8a" style="width: 512px;"/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q8b.PNG" alt="Survey Question 8b" style="width: 512px;"/>
<summary> </summary>
</details>

 - Most of our participants were not gardening experts so they may want the application to at least somewhat guide them through gardening.<details>
<summary>__Survey Question 9__ _(click to expand)_:</summary><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q9a.PNG" alt="Survey Question 9a" style="width: 512px;"/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q9b.PNG" alt="Survey Question 9b" style="width: 512px;"/>
<summary> </summary>
</details>

 - As expected most people skipped the last question but there is a comment that such an application would be most useful for managing lots of plants. Thus we should make our UI work just as well with hundreds or thousands of plants as it does with a few dozen. <details>
<summary>__Survey Question 10__ _(click to expand)_:</summary><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/Survey/q10.PNG" alt="Survey Question 10" style="width: 512px;"/>
<summary> </summary>
</details>

 - Overall the survey was more insightful than our 4 interviews even though we considered its questions to be less detailed than the interview questions.

## User Research Method 3: Secondary Research

### __Justification__:
Secondary research is useful in that it allows us to develop a point of view on the state of the current product marketplace.Additionally it allows us to review published material and other relevant sources, in order to develop a more informed perspective on the relevant design issues. 

---

### **Method Description:** 
We looked at the features and reviews of existing gardening applications to get an understanding of what they did well and what they completely missed.

## Reflections on User Research

### Interview: 
The primary weakness in interviews is that the interviewee tries their best to be helpful. This usually means that they don't answer questions honestly, and look for responses that would please the interviewer. In this case, the interviewees seemed afraid to critique the gardening app, as it could upset the interviewer. As a result it was difficult to ascertain what the interviewee would want out of a gardening app or even if they would actually use one. Additionally, many of those interviewed were close friends or family, who are even more likely to aim to please the interviewer rather than actually answer the questions honestly. 
 
The best remedy is to interview as many people as possible in the hopes of eliminating bias, by having as large of a sample set as possible. Additionally, contacting known gardening enthusiasts and sending them interview questions by email or through text may make them more likely to answer questions honestly. 

---

### Survey: 
The primary limitation of the survey method is that the questions are fairly broad and close-ended. This allows individuals to provide feedback in large numbers, but consequently means that the information provided isn’t very detailed and the actual perspective of the participant is not obvious. Additionally, similar to the interview approach, a major limitation is the small sample size. The small sample size does not give us an accurate representation of how potential users, as a whole, might view our app. 
 
In order to remedy this, our survey should try to give more options for each question to get a more detailed understanding of the participants goals/expectations. For example, instead of simple yes/no questions, multiple choice questions might be more useful. Additionally, it is imperative that we obtain a larger sample set. We can do this by advertising our survey on other websites and potentially paying individuals to distribute our survey. 
 
---
 
### Secondary Research: 
Since secondary research consists of data that has already been produced and is also highly variable, it is difficult to ensure that the data obtained is relevant to our scenario/design. More specifically, secondary sources usually lack specificity or do not fully address questions of concern. Additionally, different applications are aimed at different types of people with different goals and will not always correlate well with what we’re doing. Finally, secondary sources only describe current users. Current users consist of only a part of the target audience, and effectively designing a product towards them may alienate other potential users. 
 
In order to resolve some of the limitations of secondary research, we need to examine the secondary resources we find very carefully. We must select applications that are as close to our base design as possible and evaluate the functionality of all features. We can then examine the applications limitations and build in additional functionality into our own application. Additionally, we need to conduct as thorough of an investigation as possible into current problems experienced by users and figure out why customers prefer other gardening applications.

## Task Descriptions

###Task 1:
George is a 50-something year old man who obtained the gardening app in order to better manage his garden. He has just opened the application on his iPhone, and wants to add a set of plants from his garden to the application. George is familiar with smartphones, but rarely uses his phone for reasons beyond making phone calls, and texting. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
 
 - Step 1: George opens up the app
 - Step 2: George navigates to the main page
 - Step 3: George selects the “add plant” button
 - Step 4: George is prompted by a search bar, and searches the plant he wishes to add
 - Step 5: George navigates through a list of search results 
 - Step 6: George selects the plant he wants to add
 - Step 7: George is prompted by a popup asking him the quantity of the plant he wishes to add
 - Step 8: George selects the quantity of that plant
 - Step 9: George presses confirm
 - Step 10: George is redirected to the main page with all of his plant selections displayed
 - Step 11: George repeats steps 3-10 until he has added all of the plants in his garden
 
Discussion. George is an example of a typical user, as those heavily involved in gardening are likely to be older and have little experience with mobile applications. Similarly, the task type is important and routine. Most users first goal when opening the app is to add all of their plants into their “virtual garden”. 

---

###Task 2: 
Gladys is a 60-something year old who has just obtained a smart phone and her grandson has installed the gardening app on the phone for her, as she is an avid gardener and may find it useful. She particularly enjoys planting roses, but she wishes to determine how often she should water her newly planted red roses. She has very little experience with smartphones and mobile applications. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
 
 - Step 1: Gladys opens up the app
 - Step 2: Gladys navigates to the main page
 - Step 3: Gladys selects the “add plant” button
 - Step 4: Gladys is prompted by a search bar, and searches “red roses” 
 - Step 5: Gladys navigates through a list of search results 
 - Step 6: Gladys selects the top hit, “red rose” 
 - Step 7: Gladys is prompted by a popup asking her the quantity of roses she wishes to add
 - Step 8: Gladys selects the quantity of roses she wishes to add
 - Step 9: Gladys presses confirm
 - Step 10: Gladys is redirected to the main page with all of her plant selections are displayed
 - Step 11: Gladys notices there is an “info” button next to her red roses and selects it
 - Step 12: Gladys is redirected to a new page that displays a list of properties for her roses
 - Step 13: Gladys sees the heading “plant maintenance” and sees that under it, it says “water 1-2 times/week”
 - Step 14: Gladys closes the app and goes out to her garden to water her roses 
 
Discussion. Like George, Gladys and other older adults with plenty of gardening experience, are likely to find the app the most useful. Thus, even though their experience with smartphones is limited, their desire for an efficient way to manage their gardens will make them a large group of the gardening apps users. Her task is an obvious one, as many users want a way to keep track of the maintenance schedules that their gardens require. 
 
---

###Task 3:
Frank is a 20-something year old who has been using the gardening app to manage his garden for 6 months now. He has decided to restructure his garden and remove many of his old plants in order to make room for some new ones. Frank is familiar with smartphones and mobile applications. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
 
 - Step 1: Frank opens up the app
 - Step 2: Frank navigates to the main page
 - Step 3: Frank selects the “-” button displayed next to one of his plants
 - Step 4: The main page is refreshed, and Frank sees the plant has been removed from his list
 - Step 5: Frank repeats steps 3 & 4 until all plants are removed 
 
Discussion. Although Frank is much younger than George and Gladys, he is still an example of a typical user. This is because, although he is an amateur gardener, his extensive experience with smartphones means that he is likely to browse applications and the internet in order to assist him. His task is also very broad as users expect to be able to add and in this case, remove, any and all plants in their garden. 

---
 
###Task 4:
Kurt is a 19-year old Biological Sciences student in his second year at U of C. He is currently enrolled in a biology course focused on the study of plants. Kurt is finding it challenging to memorize all of the plant characteristics for his next exam. He searched the internet for an application that could help him organize the plants that are most discussed in class, and have an efficient way to study their various characteristics. Kurt is almost always on his smartphone and is familiar with nearly every aspect of it. He has many applications and is always looking for apps that can improve his life in one way or another. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
 
 - Step 1: Kurt opens up the app
 - Step 2: Kurt navigates to the main page
 - Step 3: Kurt selects the “add plant” button
 - Step 4: Kurt is prompted by a search bar, and searches the (first) plant he wishes to add
 - Step 5: Kurt navigates through a list of search results 
 - Step 6: Kurt selects the top hit that has the correct latin name 
 - Step 7: Kurt is prompted by a popup asking him the quantity of the plant he wished to add 
 - Step 8: Kurt inputs “1” as the quantity is irrelevant; since he only needs the info
 - Step 9: Kurt presses confirm
 - Step 10: Kurt is redirected to the main page with his plant selection displayed
 - Step 11: Kurt repeats steps 3-10 until he has added all of the plants he needs to memorize
 - Step 12: Kurt selects the “info” button next to the plant he wishes to study
 - Step 13: Kurt is redirected to a new page that displays a list of properties for the respective plant
 - Step 14: Kurt studies the relevant properties in preparation for his exam
 - Step 15: Kurt repeats steps 12-14 until he is satisfied that he has a good understanding of all the plants he is expected to know for his exam
 
Discussion: Although Kurt may not seem like an obvious user, individuals similar to him are likely to be a large portion of users who use the gardening app. This is because many users utilize apps for the information that they provide, and may not utilize all of the functionality. Kurts task is relevant as he is using the app similarly to how a typical gardener would use it; i.e. he is extracting information from the app in order to better understand the plants that are of interest to him. 
 
---
 
###Task 5:
Tony is a 20-something year old that is not an avid gardener, but has a keen interest in botany. Although he doesn’t wish to start a garden, he wishes to use the app to browse through flowers and learn more about the various types and properties of each flower. Like Frank, Tony is familiar with smartphones but has little experience with gardening. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
 
 - Step 1: Tony opens up the app
 - Step 2: Tony navigates to the main page
 - Step 3: Tony selects the “add plant” button
 - Step 4: Tony is prompted by a search bar, and searches “flower” 
 - Step 5: Tony navigates through a list of search results and clicks on the clicks on the thumbnail of the top hit
 - Step 6: Tony is redirected to a new page that displays a photo of the flower, and some basic information below it 
 - Step 7: Tony swipes through the various flowers and studies the properties below each photo
 - Step 8: Tony continues to swipe until he is bored
 
Discussion. Like Frank, Tony is young and his curiosity regarding gardening and his knowledge of mobile applications make him a likely user. This is because, although he has little to no experience gardening, his extensive experience with smartphones means that he is likely to browse applications to learn more about a field that interests him. His task is also broad as users, in addition to managing their garden, want to better understand the plants that are contained in said garden. 
 
---
 
###Task 6:
Sarah is a 30-something year old who is a botanist. She is an avid gardener as well. She downloaded the app and is curious to see how accurate the information provided is. If it proves to be as accurate as she hopes, she plans to use it for her own garden, and recommend it to her colleagues. She is familiar with smartphones, but does not use many applications. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
 
 - Step 1: Sarah opens up the app
 - Step 2: Sarah navigates to the main page
 - Step 3: Sarah selects the “add plant” button
 - Step 4: Sarah is prompted by a search bar, and searches “cactus” 
 - Step 5: Sarah navigates through a list of search results and clicks on the “info” tab next to the plant name 
 - Step 6: Sarah is redirected to a new page that displays a list of properties for her cactus
 - Step 7: Sarah sees the heading “properties” and verifies whether the information is correct
 - Step 8: Sarah repeats steps 3-7 until she is satisfied that the information provided is correct
 
Discussion. Sarah is a less likely type of user than the ones described previously, but her knowledge and experience of gardening means that she is a prime candidate to test the accuracy and usefulness of the information provided in the app. The task is similarly more specific, but again, if she is satisfied with the accuracy of the information provided, other (more amateur) users are likely to find it useful as well.

# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes

## Video Prototype

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6N86XXsbrI&feature=youtu.be)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6N86XXsbrI&feature=youtu.be)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The video prototype (linked above) illustrates the process of adding a plant to a garden. This is a common task for our application since users are required to do so before they are able to start managing their garden. In the video, we show the various interfaces the user may encounter, and how the user would typically go about adding a plant to their garden. In addition to outlining how a user would add a plant to their garden, we include a couple of sketches at the end of the video illustrating how the information/properties of each plant will be accessed and displayed.This section occurs immediately after the “info” button is pressed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storyboard outlines a series of steps representing the addition of a plant to a virtual garden. More specifically, the storyboard illustrates a sequence of menu screens that the user would see as they carried out the task of adding a plant to their virtual garden. This task was chosen as it helps illustrate many of the features of the application as well as preliminary menu and UI design. 

###Context of Use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task in this storyboard represents many different contexts use, since the user is likely to add a plant to their virtual garden in many different scenarios. This is because the user is required to do so in order to build/manage their virtual garden. Thus, in order to organize and plan garden maintenance, the user must first select the plant(s) they wish to manage. As a result, whether the user wishes to learn more about the properties of a specific plant, schedule maintenance, build a garden, etc., they must first add their plant of interest to their garden. This is likely the most important part of the system, functionally speaking, since the user will be carrying out this task frequently. A more detailed description and accompanying photo of the the storyboard is below:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user starts from “my garden”, which displays the current contents of their garden. Users can then add new plants by pressing the “add new plant” button. This action will redirect the user to a new page displaying two buttons labelled “search by plant” or “search by category”. These two types of search provide two alternative methods to find plants. The first one searches based on the name of plants. It will produce a list of search results of plant names that match the user's input. Alternatively, the user can search based on plant category. This is especially useful if a user wants to select a series of plants that belong to the same phylogeny. According to the category the user attempts to search, a list of plants that belongs to that category will be displayed on the screen. Users can then add plants by pressing the “+” button. They will then be prompted by a “Quantity” selection box, asking them to select the number of plants they wish to add to their garden. They then confirm or cancel their selection by pressing the checkmark or cross button. 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the users can press the “info” button to view a more detailed description of the plants. If “info” is selected, the user will be redirected to a new page displaying an image of the plant and a taskbar allowing them to alternate between “image”, “properties”, “watering”, etc. All buttons on this taskbar will change the layout of the screen and display the relevant information relating to the current taskbar selection. Additionally, the users can add new plants here by pressing “add” button (instead of using the previous list representation), and the “return” button will take the users to the previous page (list representation).

## Task-Centered System Walkthrough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gladys is a 60-something year old who has just obtained a smart phone and her grandson has installed the gardening app on the phone for her, as she is an avid gardener and may find it useful. Her grandson has taken the liberty of creating her first “virtual garden”, and leaves it to her to populate it with plants. Gladys particularly enjoys planting roses, but she wishes to determine how often she should water her newly planted red roses. She has very little experience with smartphones and mobile applications. A complete task walkthrough, detailing a complete job is represented below:
<br>

| Task step<br><br><br> | Knowledgeable?<br>Motivated?<br>Believable | Comments/suggested fixes<br><br><br> |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| a) Opens up the app | ok |  |
| b) Is presented with a menu screen and selects “My Garden List” | Knowledge lacking | Gladys is a first time smartphone user. She may not know she has to select the “my garden list” button first. <br><br>**Possible Solution:**<br>a) Make the buttons as clearly labelled as possible. Avoid clutter.<br>b) Include a “?” button|
| c) Selects the “add plant” button | Knowledge lacking | Gladys wants to figure out how often to water her roses, it may not be obvious that she has to add the plant to her garden first.<br><br>**Possible Solution:** <br>a) Include a “?” buttons to inform users how the application works.<br>b) Include a tutorial. <br>c) Redesign the interface. |
| d) Is prompted by 2 buttons for “Search by Plant” and “Search by Category” and selects “Search by plant” | No motivation to do this! | Gladys task is to figure out how often to water her roses, not add a new plant to her garden. She may have been motivated enough to click the “add plant button”, but by this point she may become frustrated. <br><br>Note: Investigate a possible design solution that can solve this problem. <br><br> **Possible Solution:** <br>a) Redesign the interface to allow users to browse information about plants without first adding a plant to their garden<br>b) Include a tutorial explaining how the |
| e) Is prompted by a search bar, and searches “red roses”  | ok | A search bars function is pretty obvious to a user. Since the search bar is the most prominent thing displayed on the page, Gladys is likely to select it. <br><br>She is also likely to be motivated to do this as she finally sees an opportunity to complete her task. |
| f) Navigates through a list of search results  | ok | The results are presented in a list form. It is easy to read and Gladys is likely to understand what is being displayed. |
| g) Selects the “+” button next to the top hit, “red rose”  | Knowledge low, motivation high | Gladys is glad to see her plant “red roses” displayed in the results. However, Gladys may not know what the “+” button does. <br><br>**Possible Solution:** Add text below the button that reads “add plant” |
| h) Is prompted by a popup asking her the quantity of roses she wishes to add | ok | The purpose of the display is obvious. Gladys is likely to know what the prompt means.  |
| i) Selects the quantity of roses she wishes to add | Motivation low | Again, Gladys task it to figure out how often she needs to water her roses. She may not want to go through building a garden first before finding the necessary information. <br><br>Note: Explore different interface designs that would allow a user to look at a plants properties without having to add it to their garden first <br><br>**Possible Solution:** Add a tutorial explaining how the application works |
| j) Presses confirm | ok | The button is clearly labeled and is coloured bright green. Gladys is unlikely to make a slip here.  |
| k) Is redirected to the main page where all of her plant selections are displayed | ok | Gladys is happy to see her “red roses” displayed in her garden. |
| l) Notices there is an “info” button next to her red roses and selects it | Motivation high, Knowledge lacking | Gladys finally sees her plant displayed, but she may not know that the information button is the one she needs to click to access the roses properties. <br><br>**Possible Solution:** A “?” buttons explaining the meaning of each button on the page might assist her.  |
| m) Gladys is redirected to a new page that displays a list of properties for her roses | ok | At this point, Gladys motivation is high, she sees the red roses on the screen and is closer to finishing her task. |
| n) Gladys sees the heading “plant maintenance” and sees that under it, it says “water 1-2 times/week” | ok | Everything is clearly labeled in this display. It will be easy for Gladys to read the text and understand the information provided. |
| o) Closes the app and goes out to her garden to water her roses  | ok |   |

### Summary:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major issue the task-centered walkthrough identified was that requiring the user to first build a garden by adding plants may be frustrating and confusing. Different users have different goals, and building their garden first may not occur to them. Possible solutions included a “?” button to explain the meaning of each button, a tutorial explaining how the application works, or a redesign of the interface which would allow the user to browse information about their plants without having to add them to their garden.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, button naming was determined to be an issue. In some cases, buttons were poorly labeled or their function was not made clear to the user. The best solution to this problem is to label the buttons more appropriately, or use a combination of text and symbols to make their function more obvious.

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram
### Description and summary of brainstorming process

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going into the brainstorming process, we had a clear idea of the features and issues that needed to be addressed. Thus, over the course of several days, we met up and discussed our solutions to solving those issues as well as arriving at new solutions as a group. More specifically, we rehashed existing ideas and generated completely new design solutions. Additionally, meeting over several days allowed us to sleep on the ideas and features we wished to eventually implement in our application. This allowed us to really think about the efficacy of our ideas and if they were genuinely suitable for our application. 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of our sketches during this process was to better explain and visualize our ideas as a group. Additionally, the sketches were used for ensuring consensus around an idea and to serve as an archive of what we had already thought of. Overall, we tried to come up with at least two or three completely unique systems or layouts for each of the major components of our application. That way we were less likely to get stuck on a single set of ideas. 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sketching, we relied mostly on paper and pencils and required little else besides glue and scissors. A whiteboard would have come in handy for quickly sketching ideas as a group, but that would have been harder to archive for other parts of the assignment; such as the video prototype or storyboard. As such, we completed our sketches on pieces of paper that we could easily reuse in the video prototype and storyboard.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the process we occasionally ended up mixing and matching elements from existing ideas when coming up with new ideas rather than coming up with completely new solutions. Despite this, we were still able to come up with novel ideas that could be easily implemented.

### Articulation of the Three Separate Sketches

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;__Affinity Diagram__ _(click to expand)_:</summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/P2/AffinityDiagram/Affinity%20Diagram%20Main.jpg" alt="Affinity Diagram" style="width: 512px;"/>
</details>
<summary> </summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our affinity diagram, we selected 3 separate sketches. More specifically, we selected a group of sketches representing 3 main ideas. The different groupings/sketches are listed below:


#### Garden Management (Design): 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This collection of sketches represent one main idea. Namely, the design of the interface for adding, removing, organizing, and browsing through various plants. Each sketch represents a different aspect of the central idea or a possible variation. All sketches depend upon each other in order to manage a person's garden.<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Garden Management Sketches__ _(click to expand)_:</summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/P2/AffinityDiagram/Garden%20Management.png" alt="Garden Management Sketches" style="width: 512px;"/>
</details>
<summary> </summary>
 

#### Home Screen Design: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we experimented with multiple designs for the home screen. One sketch represents the Home screen as a series of buttons containing profile and settings options. As well as a button to redirect to a “My Garden List” which contains all the user's gardens as well as an option to add a new garden. The second sketch is a more visual representation of the ideas communicated in the previous sketch. Rather than have buttons containing text, they are replaced by a Thumbnail with a relevant header and photo. <details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Home Screen Sketches__ _(click to expand)_:</summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/P2/AffinityDiagram/Home%20Screen%20Design.png" alt="Home Screen Sketches" style="width: 512px;"/>
</details>
<summary> </summary>
 

#### Personalization:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consists of two sketches. From the home screen, the user will have the option to personalize their account. This can mean changing relevant settings (such as layout, colour, language, etc) or fill in profile details (Age, Country, Profile Pic, etc). More specifically, the settings tab contains options for Display, Language, and Location. In the Display tab, the user can modify text size, theme, and how plants are categorized. The language tab gives the user the option to select a different language or enable latin naming for plants. The location tab has the option to enable location services. <details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Personalization Sketches__ _(click to expand)_:</summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/P2/AffinityDiagram/Personalization.png" alt="Personalization Sketches" style="width: 512px;"/>
</details>
<summary> </summary>
 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second sketch represents a My Profile tab which contains all of the profile information for the user. More specifically, it contains information relating to the individual's age, location, and gender and a thumbnail picture. There is also a list of general information displayed below the profile pic such as number of gardens, number of plants, time spent on app, etc.

## Reflection

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we went through the ideation process we were constantly refining designs as we continued to come up with errors that the user may run into. This made designing the system as a whole difficult, as each step needed to be constantly reexamined as the current implementation was error prone. Eventually, we applied an error analysis approach and designed each UI partly based upon the errors we expected users to make. Additionally, it was difficult for us to come up with many ideas that were truly different from one another. We frequently got stuck on refining one idea and coming up with multiple variations for the same idea. Finally, we found it difficult to sketch all of our ideas as accurately as possible. Some of our ideas were fairly elaborate and sketching them accurately was time consuming and error prone (we frequently made mistakes as we are not used to sketching). In comparison, the storyboard and video prototype went a lot more smoothly. It was much easier to visualize how everything came together, and how to organize our thoughts into a cohesive presentation. 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to do this again, we would spend a greater amount of time conducting an error analysis prior to finalizing our idea on paper. This would save us a lot of time spent sketching and re-sketching. Next, we would structure our process such that we forced ourselves to come up with a totally novel idea every few minutes. This would force us to come up with as many ideas as possible instead of making a poorer idea work. Finally, in order to decrease the time spent sketching, we would probably use another method besides simple pencil and paper. Sketching using a whiteboard or software application would actually be quicker for us since we’re not too familiar with visualizing ideas by sketching them with pencil and paper.

# P3: Hi-fi Prototypes and Heuristic Evaluation

## Link to Demo System

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Link to our Hi-fi prototype](http://lqcvkk.axshare.com/#g=1&p=mainmenu)

## Highlight Walkthrough

###Add a plant to a garden (list implementation):
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/P3/Walkthrough/image1.png "Adding a plant")

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above images shows the steps necessary to add a plant to a users garden. This task was selected as it is important and routine. Most users first goal when opening the app is to add their plants into their “virtual garden”. To do this, a user simply has to select “My Garden” from the main menu, select a previously created Garden, click “Add New Plant” in that gardens menu, search the plant they wish to add in the search bar, click the “+” button next to the plant they wish to add, and then confirm that they wish to add the plant to their garden. 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interface was designed to be as intuitive, efficient, and as easy to see as possible. Thus, the buttons are all large with bolded black text so they can be easily read, symbols are large and colour coded based on function, and each page is made to look as uncluttered as possible. We tried to make the interface primarily functional, removing extraneous information and elaborate design elements in order to keep it as simple to use as possible. 


###Remove a Plant:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/P3/Walkthrough/image2.png "Removing a plant")

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above images show the steps necessary in order to remove a plant from a user’s garden. This task was chosen as it was routine and therefore the design elements were important to get right.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plant info page was designed with a simpler background and colour palette than the previous navigation menus. This was done to call attention to, among other things, buttons on the page. In this case, the red “x” button in the top right screen. When the user presses the “x” button, they are prompted with a message asking them if they wish to delete this plant, once they confirm they are redirected to the “My Plants” menu with their plant removed. 

###Browsing through plant information and maintenance:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/P3/Walkthrough/image3.png "Browsing plant info")

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguably the most important task of our application is the ability to be able to individually browse through plant properties, and manage maintenance schedules. When the plant icon is clicked, the user is redirected to a page with a taskbar (bottom of the page), which allows them to select between plant image, properties, and maintenance. The properties tab contains information related to the plant’s appearance, defining characteristics, and scientific classification. The maintenance tab contains water schedules, pruning guidelines, soil pH, etc. Both the properties and the maintenance tabs can be edited by the user to add their own notes.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “maintenance schedule” button is in the “My Plants” screen; above all of the thumbnails representing the plants in the user’s garden. It is there to call attention to the fact that the maintenance schedule is calculated for ALL the plants in the garden. Once the button is clicked, the user is redirected to a screen displaying a calendar with individual dates marked with a black dot underneath. Once a date is clicked, the user is notified with what they have to do to their garden on that day. In this case, the user must “water alba rose”. 
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All screens displaying information specific to the garden itself have plainer backgrounds and colour palettes, this is to differentiate them from the navigation menus. As well as making them simpler to read, navigate through, and understand. 


## Heuristic Evaluation Results

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to present our heuristic evaluation in table form, with the table being sorted by severity rating (highest to lowest). Thus, our table was sorted based upon the problems that we wished to address first. Below is our group heuristic evaluation formatted into a table with collectively agreed upon severity ratings and potential fixes:


|Heuristic Name|Issue|Possible Solutions|Severity Rating| 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
|Help and documentation|There is no help or documentation page that provides information for how to use the app.|Add a help and documentation page to the design of the app. More specifically, add an information icon at the top right or bottom left of each screen, explaining the functionality and containing various tutorials or hints in case our design isn’t intuitive for some users.|4| 
|Error Prevention|Currently, if a user presses the “x” button next to their garden, the garden is deleted with no “confirm” prompt. |Add a prompt that asks the user to either confirm or cancel their selection.|3| 
|Visibility of system status|Some of the options in the settings tab change “modes” such as plant naming, language, accounting for weather, etc. which might be confusing to users.|Allow some settings to be modified outside of the settings page where they have an effect. For example, allow the weather to be enabled/disabled in the calendar page.|3| 
|User Control and Freedom|It is slightly difficult to return to the home screen as there is no dedicated home button. Currently, the user has to press the back button repeatedly until they reach the home screen. |Add a home button to the top right of the screen. The home button would be a symbol representing a generic house, text can be added to be more descriptive. |3| 
|Flexibility and efficiency of use|Currently, the system only allows users to search by plant names; there is no browse or search by category implementation. |We can create a list of plants and store them based upon category.  Thus, a user can simply search an entire category of plants rather than a single plant.|3| 
|Recognition rather than recall|The search feature requires at least a vague memory of what is being searched for.|Add a browsing/catalogue system where the user can click through different categories rather than forcing them to search for something.|3| 
|Consistency and standards|GardenList has its elements in a list, PlantList has its elements in a grid, and then PlantSearch displays its results in a list.|Either always use a grid or always use a list. Just stay consistent.|3| 
|Consistency and Standards|Currently, there are two ways to add plants to a garden; either through the standard list method, or using the visual “Plant Browse” screen. However, users may be confused as to whether or not they are actually different, and may never use both methods.|We can create an application guide or help section to inform the user of the two different methods, and their purpose/functionality.|3| 
|Match between system and the real world|The categorization system would be primarily based on phylogenies. Users may not understand phylogeny categorization.|Implement a setting allowing users to design their own categorizations. They can then group plants based upon their own criteria.|2| 
|Visibility of System |The search gives the user no feedback; no symbols, prompts, etc. The user simply has to wait and hope that their search returns results. |Have a “loading…” pop up, or a spinner that lets the user know that the system is currently conducting a search. |
| 
|Consistency and Standards|The background for the MyGardens, MyPlantList, and the main menu are vastly different to all other pages. |Find a compromise between the two backgrounds and use a background that is best suited for ALL of the screens. |2| 
|Consistency and Standards|The plant info and plant browse pages are very similar in format, but serve completely different purposes. |Use a different naming/colour palette to differentiate the two interfaces. |2| 
|Visibility of system status|When the user wants to search for a specific plant in the search bar, it will give the list of plants, however, it never displays whether the plant is found or not. Thus, the user could be returned a list of plants that are not what they searched for, or nothing at all (in which case they’ll assume the application is still searching).|Make a dialog that confirms whether the plant that the users searched is found or not. |2| 
|Consistency and standards|The cross on PlantInfo sort of looks like you would remove the plant name rather than the plant.|Perhaps moving it up to beside the header.|2| 
|Aesthetic and Minimalist design|The properties tab in plantinfo and plantbrowse, contains a lot of information; some of which might seem irrelevant to the user. |Edit the information that is not necessary; anything that doesn’t improve the users experience. |1| 
|Aesthetic and minimalist design|When the users want to search a specific plant, it will give a list of plants. It is sorted by the best match. However, it gives unrelated plants at the same time.|The search will only output the one that the users want to add and the rest of plants should not be shown.|1|

Based on the severity ratings above, we compiled the following list of “must fix before release” issues (problems with a severity rating of 3 or higher). Their possible solutions and the heuristics violated are outlined in the table above:
- The lack of a help feature.
- The lack of a confirmation prompt when removing a garden.
- The settings options basically serving as modes.
- The search feature relying on recall rather than recognition.
- The plants basically lacking any kind of sorting.
- The inconsistent layouts used where we have lists for some things and grids for others.
- The two different ways of adding a plant may be confusing to users.
- The lack of a return to menu button.


## Raw Heuristic Evaluation Notes

Note: 
   - Ratings are in the order of Kevin's, Sebastian's, and Jie's ratings. So 0, 1, 2 would mean that Kevin gave it a rating of 0 while Sebastian gave it a rating of 1 and Jie gave it a rating of 2.
   - Thos ratings are integer values 0 to 4, where 0 is not an issue at all and 4 is an experience breaking issue which must be fixed before release.
   - These notes were written independently of each other so there is some overlap.
   - The severity ratings were likewise done independently of each other and in no specific ordering. Obviously for the sake of readability they were formatted into a nice and easy to follow order. This is basically the only thing that differs from our raw heuristic evaluation notes.

### Kevin's heuristic analysis notes

|Visibility of system status|Potentially since there is no progress bar integration into the search feature that can inform the user that their input is being matched against the database then if the search takes too long the user may begin to wonder if everything is still working.|Modify the design of the search feature to include some indication that a search is being processed rather than simply relying on quick results to inform the user that things are indeed happening.|2, 3, 2|
|Help and documentation|There is no help or documentation page which can provide information for how to use the app.|Add a help and documentation page to the design of the app. Maybe scatter a few question marks throughout the application which can serve as a on the spot tutorials or hints in case our design isn’t intuitive for some user.|3, 4, 3|

# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Gardening Application is designed to allow users to manage their gardens more effectively than previous gardening applications. While other gardening applications are error prone, inaccurate, and hard to use, our Gardening Application is simple, easy to use, and highly informative. 

#####Our Gardening Application allows users to:
 - Add plants to their garden
 - Remove plants in their garden
 - Browse properties and maintenance information for each of their respective plants
 - Organize plant maintenance using a calendar
 - Search and browse through plants that interest them
 - Personalize their account (multiple users, change settings)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this report, we summarize the findings of our user research, heuristic evaluation, as well as discuss/justify our final design and outline our recommendations for future iterations of this design. 


## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of our project was to create a gardening guide in the form of a mobile application. The gardening guide we developed is currently able to assist in planning, managing, maintaining and tracking a users garden. Gardening applications are fairly common, but many lack expected features, are hard to use, error-prone, or are poorly organized. Our objective/motivation was to design a gardening application that addressed these issues, and would meet users expectations. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect our application to be used by gardeners with variable experience and background. Thus, the age group, technological abilities, physical and mental abilities, and gender vary quite a bit in our expected users. However, we expect most of our users to not be technological experts. Since gardening is typically a home hobby, the context under which we expect our application to be used in is a relatively calm and relaxed home setting. 


## Design Problem

__Problem:__ Design a gardening application which assists in planning, managing, maintaining and tracking a given garden. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus for our project was to make a gardening application that was streamlined and useful. Many gardening applications are clouded with erroneous content, are poorly updated, error prone, difficult to use, etc, and thus we wanted to design an application that addressed many of these problems. Below we outlined a set of issues/characteristics that would need to be addressed when designing our application: 

- __Simple/Organized__ 
    - Abstract away useless information, settings, and content.
- __Easy to navigate (User Friendly)__
    - Common problem among current applications. Menu design should be clearly laid out and the function of each page should be obvious. 
- __Useful__
    - Many applications get too focused on providing accurate plant information that they forget about the management aspect.
- __Personalizable__ 
    - Everyone's garden and practices are different. Designing for everyone is impossible, thus we should allow the user to modify settings to enable/disable features and/or naming conventions. 
- __Accurate (in regards to plant properties and maintenance)__ 
    - The information provided in regards to watering and pruning schedules on some applications are not always accurate. Thus, it is important that we design an application that has information that is well sourced. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many garden applications do not successfully address the issues above, which makes them unpopular and not useful. By addressing these issues, we hoped to design a gardening application that would prove to be useful, informative, and user friendly. 


## User Research and Findings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were conducting our user research, we employed the following three research methods. Their description and findings are below (For more detailed method descriptions and justifications refer to P3):
&nbsp;&nbsp;__1. Interviews__
&nbsp;&nbsp;__2. Survey__
&nbsp;&nbsp;__3. Secondary Research__

### __1. Summary of Interview Findings:__
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We interviewed 4 individuals that we considered to be a good representation of our target audience. We sat down with them, asked our questions and summarized their responses. Listed below are our primary findings from the interviews:

 - Our interviewees mainly keep track of their garden by memory or visual assessment; although one of them uses a calendar.
 - A common issue seems to be finding the time to do gardening.
 - A common goal is to be able to see the results of their work. As in all their plants survive and look great.
 - The participants seemed to be at least somewhat familiar with technology.
 - Interviewees were confused by some of the questions and required clarification. This was particularly problematic as we didn’t want to influence our interviewees answers.

### __2. Summary of Survey Findings:__
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey we created consisted of 10 questions and none of them were required to be filled out by the participant. The survey consisted of mainly closed questions so that we could have a more qualitative analysis of the results. We posted the survey on SurveyMonkey and then shared the link to it on social media. That resulted in 12 responses to our survey. Listed below is a summary of our major findings:

 - Nearly all of the participants grow some kind of edible plants in their gardens. Indicating that some kind of harvest tracking should be a high priority feature.
 - Most people seem to spend less than 3 hours on gardening per week, at least on average. 
 - Exactly half of our participants are the only person involved in maintaining their garden. 
 - People tend to either water plants on a fixed schedule or only wait a few days for rainfall. Most participants seem to get a decent amount of rainfall so we should certainly consider rainfall when designing the watering/maintaining section of our application.
 - Most participants would consider using an application for managing their garden.
 - Despite tools for planning/setting up a garden winning by first past the post standards, tools for maintaining/managing a garden seem to be more desired.
 - Most of our participants were not gardening experts so they may want the application to at least somewhat guide them through gardening.
 - As expected, most people skipped the last question but there is a comment that such an application would be most useful for managing lots of plants. Thus we should make our UI work just as well with hundreds or thousands of plants as it does with a few dozen.
 - Overall the survey was more insightful than our 4 interviews even though we considered its questions to be less detailed than the interview questions.


### __3. Summary of Secondary Research Findings__
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked at the features and reviews of existing gardening applications to get an understanding of what they did well and what they completely missed.

## Design and Justification

&nbsp;&nbsp;[Link to our Hi-fi prototype](http://lqcvkk.axshare.com/#g=1&p=mainmenu)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the introduction, the focus of our project was to make a gardening application that was streamlined and useful. From our secondary research findings, we determined that many gardening applications are clouded with erroneous content, are poorly updated, error prone, difficult to use, etc. Thus, we outlined a set of issues that were known to be problematic and then designed our interface with them in mind. These issues helped justify our design choices, and shape our Hi-Fi Prototype:

- __Simple/Organized__ 
    - Each screen has as few buttons as possible, and has as little text as possible. The design of the “Plant Info” screen was harder to simplify/organize because we wanted to make sure the user had all the information they would need to properly manage their garden. As a temporary solution, we made the text editable, so the user can remove or add additional text.
    - The “Plant Search” screen design was also influenced by this concept. We wanted to keep the search feature as simple as possible so that people unfamiliar with mobile devices would find it easy to use.

- __Easy to navigate (User Friendly)__
    - All screens displaying information specific to the garden itself have plainer backgrounds and colour palettes, this is to differentiate them from the navigation menus. As well as making them simpler to read, navigate through, and understand. 
    - This impacted the design of our headings. We wanted to convey as best we could what the function of each page was. Hence headings such as “My Plants”, “My Gardens”, “Plant Search”, and “Plant Browse”. 

- __Useful__
    - We determined early on that certain features in gardening applications were more popular compared to others. Among these were features allowing users to schedule garden maintenance, and allow them to examine individual plant properties. This led to the implementation of the “Plant Information” and “Maintenance Schedule” screens in our prototype. 

- __Personalizable__ 
    - Our user research indicated that in some cases, multiple individuals share a garden with another person in the same household. Thus, we implemented the “My Profile” tab to allow multiple users to create and customize their gardens. Thereby allowing multiple users in one household to manage their garden using the same device. 
    - Some of the features like the “weather services” setting may not be wanted by some users and similarly, others prefer different plant naming conventions. Thus, we created a settings tab to allow users to set their own preferences. Thus, more experienced users can choose which features they want implemented. 

- __Accurate (in regards to plant properties and maintenance)__ 
    - It is difficult to ensure accuracy in regards to plant information due to the sheer amount of plant species in a typical database. However, in our case, we cross referenced at least 3-4 separate sites to ensure that the properties listed, and the watering and pruning schedule were consistent among them for the example we included in our prototype (the Alba Rose). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We justified many of our design ideas by referring to the issues above. By doing so, we hoped that our gardening application would prove to be useful, informative, and user friendly. Included below is a set of storyboards illustrating the final design of our prototype, with the design elements that were explained and justified above. A brief walkthrough is presented with each storyboard. We included the storyboards below in order to demonstrate how the issues above shaped elements of our design, and to get a better sense of how the application works:



__Adding a Plant to a Garden:__

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/P4/image2.png "Adding a plant")

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above images outline the steps necessary to add a plant to a users garden. This task was selected as it is important and routine. Most users first goal when opening the app is to add their plants into their “virtual garden”. To do this, a user simply has to select “My Garden” from the main menu, select a previously created Garden, click “Add New Plant” in that gardens menu, search the plant they wish to add in the search bar, click the “+” button next to the plant they wish to add, and then confirm that they wish to add the plant to their garden.


__Browsing through plant information and maintenance__

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Beskamir/481-project-template/master/Resources/Images/P4/image1.png "Removing a plant")

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the plant icon is clicked, the user is redirected to a page with a taskbar (bottom of the page), which allows them to select between plant image, properties, and maintenance.The “maintenance schedule” button is in the “My Plants” screen; above all of the thumbnails representing the plants in the user’s garden. It is there to call attention to the fact that the maintenance schedule is calculated for ALL the plants in the garden. Once the button is clicked, the user is redirected to a screen displaying a calendar with individual dates marked with a black dot underneath. Once a date is clicked, the user is notified with what they have to do to their garden on that day. In this case, the user must “water alba rose”.


## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to evaluate the design of our system, we performed a heuristic evaluation. This involved each group member doing a heuristic analysis separately and then meeting as a group to run through the heuristic analysis together and discuss violated heuristics and assign severity ratings. We decided to present our heuristic evaluation in table form, with the table being sorted by severity rating (highest to lowest). Thus, our table was sorted based upon the problems that we wished to address first. Below is our group heuristic evaluation formatted into a table with collectively agreed upon severity ratings and potential fixes:

|Heuristic Name|Issue|Possible Solutions|Severity Rating| 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
|Help and documentation|There is no help or documentation page that provides information for how to use the app.|Add a help and documentation page to the design of the app. More specifically, add an information icon at the top right or bottom left of each screen, explaining the functionality and containing various tutorials or hints in case our design isn’t intuitive for some users.|4| 
|Error Prevention|Currently, if a user presses the “x” button next to their garden, the garden is deleted with no “confirm” prompt. |Add a prompt that asks the user to either confirm or cancel their selection.|3| 
|Visibility of system status|Some of the options in the settings tab change “modes” such as plant naming, language, accounting for weather, etc. which might be confusing to users.|Allow some settings to be modified outside of the settings page where they have an effect. For example, allow the weather to be enabled/disabled in the calendar page.|3| 
|User Control and Freedom|It is slightly difficult to return to the home screen as there is no dedicated home button. Currently, the user has to press the back button repeatedly until they reach the home screen. |Add a home button to the top right of the screen. The home button would be a symbol representing a generic house, text can be added to be more descriptive. |3| 
|Flexibility and efficiency of use|Currently, the system only allows users to search by plant names; there is no browse or search by category implementation. |We can create a list of plants and store them based upon category. Thus, a user can simply search an entire category of plants rather than a single plant.|3| 
|Recognition rather than recall|The search feature requires at least a vague memory of what is being searched for.|Add a browsing/catalogue system where the user can click through different categories rather than forcing them to search for something.|3| 
|Consistency and standards|GardenList has its elements in a list, PlantList has its elements in a grid, and then PlantSearch displays its results in a list.|Either always use a grid or always use a list. Just stay consistent.|3| 
|Consistency and Standards|Currently, there are two ways to add plants to a garden; either through the standard list method, or using the visual “Plant Browse” screen. However, users may be confused as to whether or not they are actually different, and may never use both methods.|We can create an application guide or help section to inform the user of the two different methods, and their purpose/functionality.|3| 
|Match between system and the real world|The categorization system would be primarily based on phylogenies. Users may not understand phylogeny categorization.|Implement a setting allowing users to design their own categorizations. They can then group plants based upon their own criteria.|2| 
|Visibility of System |The search gives the user no feedback; no symbols, prompts, etc. The user simply has to wait and hope that their search returns results. |Have a “loading…” pop up, or a spinner that lets the user know that the system is currently conducting a search. |2| 
|Consistency and Standards|The background for the MyGardens, MyPlantList, and the main menu are vastly different to all other pages. |Find a compromise between the two backgrounds and use a background that is best suited for ALL of the screens. |2| 
|Consistency and Standards|The plant info and plant browse pages are very similar in format, but serve completely different purposes. |Use a different naming/colour palette to differentiate the two interfaces. |2| 
|Visibility of system status|When the user wants to search for a specific plant in the search bar, it will give the list of plants, however, it never displays whether the plant is found or not. Thus, the user could be returned a list of plants that are not what they searched for, or nothing at all (in which case they’ll assume the application is still searching).|Make a dialog that confirms whether the plant that the users searched is found or not. |2| 
|Consistency and standards|The cross on PlantInfo sort of looks like you would remove the plant name rather than the plant.|Perhaps moving it up to beside the header.|2| 
|Aesthetic and Minimalist design|The properties tab in plantinfo and plantbrowse, contains a lot of information; some of which might seem irrelevant to the user. |Edit the information that is not necessary; anything that doesn’t improve the users experience. |1| 
|Aesthetic and minimalist design|When the users want to search a specific plant, it will give a list of plants. It is sorted by the best match. However, it gives unrelated plants at the same time.|The search will only output the one that the users want to add and the rest of plants should not be shown.|1|

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the severity ratings above, we compiled the following list of issues that must be fixed in future iterations of the design (problems with a severity rating of 3 or higher). Their possible solutions and the heuristics violated are outlined in the table above:

- The lack of a confirmation prompt when removing a garden.
- The lack of a help feature.
- The settings options basically serving as modes.
- The search feature relying on recall rather than recognition.
- The plants basically lacking any kind of sorting.
- The inconsistent layouts used where we have lists for some things and grids for others.
- The two different ways of adding a plant may be confusing to users.
- The lack of a return to menu button.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the heuristic violations identified above had to do with the layout of the system as a whole. Some of the menu designs were confusing, and not as intuitive to use as we previously thought. However, many of these issues are easily solvable. Among the most important issues is that of the search bar, which prevents users from browsing through plants they may want to buy, or searching based on category rather than plant name. This was an issue that came up both during the prototype demo and while conducting the heuristic evaluation. It differs from the other issues as it is more difficult to address, as the search bar implementation would need to be removed completely and replaced with an entirely new “browse” feature. 

## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Heuristic Evaluation and the comments from the prototype presentation, we came up with the following set of solutions to address the major usability issues identified in our hi-fi prototype:

- __Add a confirmation button when creating or removing a garden__
    - __(Justification)__ The lack of a confirmation prompt means that the user can accidentally delete their entire garden, which they may have spent hours organizing. This is a major issue as this makes the application not only user un-friendly but frustrating to use. 

- __Make modes clear and modifiable (or remove them entirely)__ 
    - __(Justification)__ The presence of these modes will no doubt be confusing to new users. They also make the application less discoverable as modifying these settings could completely change how the application works/is formatted.  

- __Allow some settings to be modified outside of the settings page where they have an effect. For example, allow the weather to be enabled/disabled in the calendar page__
    - __(Justification)__ Currently, the user must navigate to the settings menu by pressing “back” repeatedly in order to enable or disable weather services (this modifies the plant maintenance schedule according to the weather at your location). This is a minor problem, as users would not be able to compare the effect it has on garden maintenance easily. It makes more sense to have the option enabled here, or at least have an icon that can redirect to the setting page. 

- __Implement a browsing/catalogue system where the user can click through different categories rather than forcing them to search for a plant name__
    - __(Justification)__ The current system employs a search bar to look up plants. This means that users must know how to spell their plant names accurately, and can only view plants they know of. This is a poor design choice, a browse feature that allows users to look through different categories and groupings makes more sense. 

- __Unify the layout of similar parts of the app so that it is more consistent__
    - __(Justification)__ Multiple interfaces in the application have different layouts, despite working similarly. This is confusing. The lack of consistency makes the application less learnable.  

- __Implement a return to main menu header for the entire app__
    - __(Justification)__ Having to click “back” repeatedly to get to the home screen is not only tedious, but also time consuming and frustrating. A simple home button would fix this quickly. 

- __Create a help menu which can be accessed from any page__
    - __(Justification)__ The lack of a help menu means that the user has no way of figuring out what each button is for, or how to use the app; they must proceed by trial and error. Initially, we considered this to be a catastrophic error, but after reconsideration, this appears to be a minor issue (a well designed interface should not need a help button). 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above list of solutions gives an overview of what we could do to improve the current application, but we also had concerns whether our current design/structure was actually the best way of building a gardening application. Most of the issues we identified were from user research, which also shaped the layout, which features we implemented, and various other aspects of the design. We interviewed gardeners, conducted surveys, and even looked at similar applications. However, we still are slightly uncertain if real world users would actually like our design, and if the features we implemented would actually work.Thus, in the next iteration of the design, we would like to conduct more user research, with much larger sample sets for both the interviews and surveys. Thus, we would get a better understanding of our targeted users, their expectations, goals, and feelings. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we were fairly unsatisfied with some of our layouts/graphics/transitions in our HiFi-Prototype. Time constraints meant that we couldn’t make each screen as visually enticing as we wanted, and had to find a compromise. This was especially true of the “My Plants” page which was not only sparse, but visually unappealing. This made it difficult to imagine what the application would actually look like, and since this is a high fidelity prototype, the appearance of the screens should be relatively close to what the actual application would look like. Thus, for the next iteration of the design, we would do some C.R.A.P design in order to help break things up; make headers more obvious, further remove blocks of unnecessary text, make the screens more consistent, and more visually enticing to the user. 

## Conclusions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our prototype successfully implemented all of the necessary features we outlined early on, but we, as well as others, identified numerous problems regarding our layout and some of the features. The findings from our heuristic evaluation identified similar issues. We examined possible solutions, and came up with a set of recommended fixes for future iterations of the design. Further user research, and more data will help refine/address many of the poorly designed aspects of our application. All things considered, we are fairly satisfied with our prototype and are confident that by addressing the issues presented above, we would eliminate many of the reservations we (and others) have with the current implementation.
