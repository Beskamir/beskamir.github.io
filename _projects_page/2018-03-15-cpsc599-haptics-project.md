Course project for the *Computer Haptics* course (Computer Science 599.86 at the University of Calgary) I took in winter 2018. 

<!--more-->

Unfortunately I don't have access to the haptic devices anymore and even if I did it'd be difficult to show haptics with just images or videos anyway.

###### Source code is self-hosted on my home Git-Gogs server which is only accessible from my home network.
