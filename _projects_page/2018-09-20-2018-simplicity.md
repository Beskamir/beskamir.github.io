Collection of entries for Remington's 2018 simplicity challenge where the objective was to create some cool artwork while only using a limited amount of Blender's features.

## Justification

Grant Wilk from Remington Graphics (now Remington Creative), hosted a Blender competition where one of the challenges was to create a model using just Blender's object mode. As such modifying individual vertices was generally against the rules unless it was done through applying transformations within object mode. Despite overlooking that it was supposed to be just a single model and not a complete scene it was still really enjoyable since 3 of my entries gave me a reason to figure out Blender's API for scripting UI inputs.

## T-Cube Fractal

### Features: 
- Simple recursive implementation of a T-Cube fractal.
   - Placed cubes recursively until a certain depth was reached.
   - Made as a simple test of Blender's scripting API.
- Added a nice procedural material to the resulting cubes.

#### Result:

## DNA Strand

### Features: 
- Considered making a script but ended up making it by hand.
- Mostly a compositing project. (It was saved in post)

## Implicit Hearts 

### Features: 
- Places voxels based on an implicit surface.
- Voxels can both be normal cubes and custom made cubes that were manually created using object mode and emulate marching cubes.

#### Result:

## Assignment 4: Deferred

### Features:
- Based on my model viewer from _[Intro to Computer Graphics](http://localhost:4000/projects/Intro-to-Graphics)_.
   - As such shares many of the features that were implemented for that assignment.
- Main addition is the deferred rendering pipeline.
- Also has Oren-Nayer diffuse shading in addition to Phong shading.
  
#### Phong lighting:

#### Oren-Nayer diffuse shading with sigma 20:

## Assignment 4: SSAO
  
### Features:
- Continuation of the previous assignment (assignment 4, deferred rendering) so many of the previous features carried over.
- Implemented Crytek's SSAO
- Rocket model was a slightly upgraded version of the rocket in the scene for assignment 1.
  
#### Diffuse lighting without SSAO:

#### Diffuse lighting with SSAO:
