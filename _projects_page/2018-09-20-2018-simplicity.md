Collection of entries for Remington's 2018 simplicity challenge where the objective was to create some cool artwork while only using a limited amount of Blender's features.

## Justification

# TODO: Fill this with the actual info stuffs

### Features: 
- Made the test scene in Blender then figured out how to export it to PBRT and automate as much of the process as possible.
- I then just added models to a selected region in the scene and had a batch script rendering each scene with PBRT using both KD and BVH acceleration.
- Once that was done all that was needed was to graph the results and realize that both increase at the same rate with just a slight difference in speed.

## Assignment 2: Apertures

### Features: 
- By default PBRT only has circular apertures.
- Extended PBRT to support any regular polygonal aperture.
- Also supports stars of any polygonal number of points despite the bonus only requiring 5 pointed stars.


#### Default PBRT aperture:

#### Regular pentagonal aperture:

#### Star aperture with 5 points:

#### Regular triangle aperture:

#### Star aperture with 3 points:

## Assignment 3: Sampling

PBRT has a bug where it will sample a half disk the same as a full disk, our task was to fix this by changing the samples so that it would be from just the half disk rather than the entire disk. Unfortunately I used rejection sampling instead of properly transforming the samples to be uniformly spaced on the disk. As such my implementation was incorrect and not particularly nice visually. As such I won't be including pictures of it here.

## Assignment 4: Deferred

### Features:
- Based on my model viewer from _[Intro to Computer Graphics](http://localhost:4000/projects/Intro-to-Graphics)_.
   - As such shares many of the features that were implemented for that assignment.
- Main addition is the deferred rendering pipeline.
- Also has Oren-Nayer diffuse shading in addition to Phong shading.
  
#### Phong lighting:

#### Oren-Nayer diffuse shading with sigma 20:

## Assignment 4: SSAO
  
### Features:
- Continuation of the previous assignment (assignment 4, deferred rendering) so many of the previous features carried over.
- Implemented Crytek's SSAO
- Rocket model was a slightly upgraded version of the rocket in the scene for assignment 1.
  
#### Diffuse lighting without SSAO:

#### Diffuse lighting with SSAO:

### Credits:
- Once again [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) has helped me figure stuff out.
