Various assignments I did for the Rendering course (Computer Science 591 at the University of Calgary) I took in winter 2019.

# BVH vs KD

## Features
- Made the test scene in Blender then figured out how to export it to PBRT and automate as much of the process as possible.
- I then just added models to a selected region in the scene and had a batch script rendering each scene with PBRT using both KD and BVH acceleration.
- Once that was done all that was needed was to graph the results and realize that both increase at the same rate with just a slight difference in speed.

### PBRT Render

#### Examples of the test objects I added to the scene

### Comparison Graph
<img src="/assets/images/Projects/Rendering/Assignments/Graph-2019-10-06_01-00-40.png" width="100%" />
Increase in render time as the number of test objects in the scene increases. Both time increases are clearly logarithmic as they barely increase while the ùë•-axis is exponential. Which matches the literature time complexity (ùëÇ(log(ùëõ)) for BVH and KD Trees. Rendered using an AMD Threadripper 1950x.

# Polygonal Apertures

## Features
- By default PBRT only has circular apertures.
- Extended PBRT to support any regular polygonal aperture.
- Also supports stars of any polygonal number of points despite the bonus only requiring 5 pointed stars.

### Default PBRT Aperture

### Regular 5-Sided Aperture

### 5-Point Star Aperture

#### Regular triangle aperture

# Sampling Fix

PBRT has a bug where it will sample a half disk the same as a full disk, our task was to fix this by changing the samples so that it would be from just the half disk rather than the entire disk. Unfortunately I used rejection sampling instead of properly transforming the samples to be uniformly spaced on the disk. As such my implementation was incorrect and visually unimpressive.

## Features
- Uses rejection sampling to ignore invalid rays.

### My horrible fix
##### (Note how the brightness decreases due to rejection sampling)

# Deferred Rendering

## Features
- Based on my model viewer from _[Intro to Computer Graphics](http://localhost:4000/projects/Intro-to-Graphics)_.
   - As such shares many of the features that were implemented for that assignment.
- Main addition is the deferred rendering pipeline.
- Also has Oren-Nayer diffuse shading in addition to Phong shading.
  
### Phong lighting

### Oren-Nayer shading
##### Sigma = 0

##### Sigma = 20

# SSAO
  
## Features
- Continuation of the previous assignment (assignment 4, deferred rendering) so many of the previous features carried over.
- Implemented Crytek's SSAO
- Rocket model was a slightly upgraded version of the rocket in the scene for assignment 1.

### Without SSAO

### With SSAO
