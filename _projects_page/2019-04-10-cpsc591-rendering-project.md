Course project for the _Rendering_ course (Computer Science 591 at the University of Calgary) I took in winter 2019 and where I implemented ray tracing that made use of Nvidia's RTX hardware through the Vulkan API.

# Project Summary

## Objective

Learn the Vulkan basics and implement ray tracing that is accelerated by Nvidia's RTX hardware. 

## Justification
- Just seemed like the coolest project idea I could think of that didn't necessarily require a load of math.
- It was a massive learning opportunity!
  - Went in not knowing Vulkan, came out at least knowing the basics.
  - This also translated to a better understanding of OpenGL and graphics APIs in general.
  - Learned how to implement RTX.
  - Got to experiment with RTX before it was supported by everything.
- Self-justification...
  - I bought a RTX2080 very shortly after launch and had to somehow justify the early adopter fee.
  
## Features
- Normal Vulkan rasterization with z-fighting. 
  - This wasn't the main objective so I didn't care enough to fix it.
- Ray tracing using RTX in Vulkan. 
  - Unfortunately only got direct lighting and simple shadows implemented.
- Expected window options supported like resizing or minimizing the window are supported.
- Can switch between rasterized and ray traced views.
- User specified camera movement with the ability to unlock the mouse so you can take screenshots or resize the window.

## Challenges
- Learning Vulkan and how to implement RTX at the same time.
