Collection of assignments I did well on for the _modeling_ course (Computer Science 589 at the University of Calgary) I am taking in fall 2019.

# Hypocycloid

## Features
- Draws [hypocycloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocycloid) of any inner and outer circle radii.
- User can change:
   - Inner and outer circle radii.
   - Resolution of the resulting curve.
   - Speed at the curve is drawn. (How many vertices are generated before showing the curve to the user)
   - Number of complete rotations of the curve.
   - Color of the curve with the alpha value alpha value defining how much of the user defined rgb values should be interpolated with colors based on the coordinates of the curve's vertices.
   - Enable/disable:
      - Outer circle outline.
      - Inner circle outline.
      - Dot indicating where the curve is being drawn.
   - Option to draw a coordinate dependent polynomial curve $$(Q(u)=P_0 + P_1u + P_2u^2, 0 \le u \le 1 )$$ which demonstrates what happens when the weights of a curve do not sum to one.
