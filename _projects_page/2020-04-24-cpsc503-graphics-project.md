Course project for the Project in Computer Graphics course (Computer Science 503.03 at the University of Calgary) I took in winter 2020 and where I upgraded the [RTX render engine I wrote last year](https://beskamir.github.io/projects/rendering-project) to support additional features such as ambient occlusion.

# Project Summary

## Objective

Apply my knowledge of Vulkan to improve neuron rendering in connectome visualizations with RTX ambient occlusion.

## Justification
- Opportunity to reuse last year's rendering project.
- Gain greater familiarity with RTX and the Vulkan API.
- Combination of computer graphics, art, and neuroscience.
- Improve existing connectome visualizations.

## Features
- Vulkan rasterizer with depth buffer.
- Ray tracer supports:
  - Direct Shadows.
  - Ambient Occlusion.
  - Diffuse Shading.
- Can switch between rasterizer and ray tracer rendering modes.
- User specified camera movement with the ability to disconnect the mouse to make screenshot taking easier.
- Uses assimp for quickly loading models with many polygons.
- Better/cleaner codebase than the previous version.
- Also supports model transformations using push constants. 
- Using a texture to encode the directions in which AO rays should be sent in.

## Challenges
- Various bugs such as accidentally destroying my acceleration structure buffer before it was finished copying and thus only being able to support about 5 thousand vertices... After resolving that bug, the ray tracer could easily support 50 million vertices.
- Learning more about the Vulkan API.
  - Push constants.
  - Depth buffer.
  - Not deleting the bottom level acceleration structure when it's still needed.
  - Passing textures to the ray tracing shaders.
  - etc.
- Creating a texture that encodes the directions in which rays should be sent for computing AO.
- Random vs Halton sequence for computing the directions in which AO rays should be sent. For some reason the Halton sequence created a repeating image texture so a random sequence was used instead.

## Final Report
[Here's a link to the final report I wrote for the course](\assets\images\Projects\NeuronAO\SebastianKopacz-FinalReport.pdf).

# Screenshots

## Final Neuron Visualization

Neuron rendered with diffuse and ray traced ambient occlusion lighting.

## Shading Comparison
<img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/026/720/716/large/sebastian-kopacz-lightingcompare.jpg?1589538133" width="100%" />
Comparison of the various shading modes my render engine supported.

## Render Engine Comparison
<img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/026/720/724/large/sebastian-kopacz-enginecompare.jpg?1589538173" width="100%" />
Ambient occlusion comparison between my render engine (labeled Vulkan) and Blender's Cycles render engine (labeled Blender). My render engine was using fewer samples but otherwise I tried to match it as closely as possible.

## Effect of AO Ray Distance
<img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/026/720/722/large/sebastian-kopacz-distancecompare.jpg?1589537986" width="100%" />
Comparison exploring the effect that ray distance has on ambient occlusion shading.

## AO Sampling
<img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/026/720/720/large/sebastian-kopacz-samplecompare.jpg?1589537980" width="100%" />
<img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/026/721/182/large/sebastian-kopacz-performance.jpg?1589539108" width="100%" />
The performance and visual impact of AO sampling without any denoising. As evident 32 samples is sufficient for a good enough effect at a high enough framerate on an RTX 2080.

## RTX Shadows
<img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/026/721/680/large/sebastian-kopacz-neurons-2020-04-08-14-01-23.jpg?1589540449" width="100%" />
<img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/026/721/682/large/sebastian-kopacz-neurons-2020-04-08-16-22-21.jpg?1589540453" width="100%" />
Unfortunately shadows detracted from neuron visualization. This is likely due to neuron's structure making shadows feel disconnected from the geometry casting them.

## AO Direction Textures
<img src="\assets\images\Projects\NeuronAO\SampleHemisphere.png" width="100%" />
<img src="\assets\images\Projects\NeuronAO\SampleTextures.png" width="100%" />
Due to time constraints I was unable to resolve why the Halton sequence resulted in an obviously repeating pattern. Instead I just used the image from the random sequence as it worked and time was a bit limited.

## Future Direction
<img src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/026/720/729/large/sebastian-kopacz-6.jpg?1589538020" width="100%" />
The Fresnel node in Blender resulted in a nice effect that highlighted neuron edges really well and might improve neuron and therefore connectome visualizations.
