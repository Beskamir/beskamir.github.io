A friend from university and I tried to make a puzzle game together.

###### Source code was self-hosted on my own Git-Gogs server which she had access to with a VPN.

# Project Summary

Set on an interstellar colony ship where the player would need to complete various puzzles to 'remain cognitively viable for the colonization effort' before ultimately also needing to fix the ship due to some kind of systems failure.

## Objective

Make an awesome puzzle game worthy of publishing to Steam.

## Justification
- Covid disrupted both of our post graduation plans, and so left with a bunch of free time on our hands, we decided to work on a game together.

## Progress
- Our initial focus was on the overall story and gameplay since those seemed the most fundamental to that game's development.
- As a result, we barely made any progress on anything visual before our other commitments caused the project to be delayed and ultimately cancelled.
