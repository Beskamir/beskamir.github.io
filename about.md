Hello, I am Sebastian Kopacz. I originally made this website to archive all the cool projects and assignments I worked on during my undergraduate degree at the University of Calgary. Since then however, this site sort of became my default portfolio despite the fact that I have been really terrible at keeping it updated with everything I have been working on.

# Contact Me

The best way of contacting me is by [email](mailto:sebastianvkopacz@gmail.com). To see more of my work you can find me on [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/beskamir), [GitHub](https://github.com/Beskamir), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ3GtOxTGVyRV8awtzV0IPg) or [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/beskamir). Otherwise I try to stay away from social media so don't expect to see me on LinkedIn or Facebook.

# Formal Education

## Bachelor of Science at the University of Calgary (2015-2020)
  - Combined degree in computer science and psychology.
    - With a concentration in computer graphics.

---

# Technical Skills

## Computer Science

### Languages

#### Proficient
- C++
  - My personal favorite programming language of choice.
  - Usually used it for graphics assignments & projects.
  - Currently using it for indie game development.
- GLSL 
  - Likewise used for graphics assignments & projects.
- Python
  - Preferred scripting language.
  - Lots of years of experience since it was the first language I learned and I still use it fairly regularly.
  - Wrote many assignments, helper scripts, games, etc. with it.
- C#
  - Preferred mid-level language.
  - Used this for several Human-Computer Interaction projects and assignments.
  - Both UE and Flax use C# for their build systems so I've remained familiar with it.
  - Flax also has a C# API but I prefer using the C++ API.

#### Capable
- ARM Assembly (v7 and v8)
  - In a group of 2 I wrote a clone of the original Super Mario Bros. game using ARMv7 assembly.
    - Also wrote the driver that let the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B we were using talk with a NES controller. 
  - Also wrote several other less flash assignments in the two courses which taught these languages.
- Haskell
  - Learned it when learning about functional programming.
  - Functional programming concepts stayed with me but I don't remember Haskell too well.
- Java
  - I dislike Java but I guess I technically know the language thanks to several courses using it and its similarity with C#.

### APIs

#### Proficient
- OpenGL - Most of my graphics assignments & projects were written using OpenGL.
- Blender - I wrote scripts to help me make art.
- Vulkan - Used Vulkan to make use of Nvidia's RTX technology for ray tracing.
- Unreal Engine 5 - Star Dust started as an UE5 game before I switched to Flax.
- Flax - A relatively recent game engine with elements of both Unity and UE in its overall design.

#### Capable
- PBRT - Most of my rendering assignments used the PBRT library.
- Keras - The machine learning research I did in summer 2018 used the Keras library. 
- CHAI3D - My haptics assignments were all done using CHAI3D.
- Unreal Engine 4 - Used CHAI3D as a driver to integrated haptics into UE4.

### Tools

#### Proficient
- JetBrains IDEs
  - Rider
  - CLion
  - IntelliJ
- VSCodium (open source version of Visual Studio Code)
- SSH
  - PuTTY
  - WinSCP

#### Capable
- Visual Studio
- Terminal editors
  - Vim
  - Nano

### Experience
- Learned programming (Python) in summer of 2015. 
- Worked on dozens of programming assignments and projects throughout my degree.
- Various personal projects ranging from simple scripts to full projects.
- Research position during the summer of 2018 where I was tasked with using machine learning to landmark faces for medical purposes.
- Indie game development and other personal projects.
- Refer to the projects section of this website for more details.

## Art

### Workflows
- Modeling using Blender:
  - Semi-procedural modeling with mesh modifiers.
  - Parametric modeling using curves and surfaces.
- Materials (shaders):
  - Creating fully procedural materials with procedural textures within Blender or UE.
  - Baking procedural textures made with Blender to texture images for use in other engines.
- Level or scene design in Blender, UE, Unity, Flax, etc.
- Rendering and compositing/post-processing systems.
- Exporting models for use in game engines or 3D printing.

### Tools

#### Proficient
- Blender
- Flax
- Unreal Engine 5

#### Capable
- Unity
- Photoshop

### Experience
- Started with Blender sometime around 2011 to 2012.
- Contributed 3D models to several modding teams.
- Participated and won a few Blender competitions.
- 3D Art Executive for the Game Design Club at the University of Calgary from 2017 to 2020.
  - Provided teaching materials and assistance for creating 3D art.
  - Created 3D assets for the club's games.
  - Helped organize and plan what 3D assets needed to be completed.
- Refer to my ArtStation profile for more details.

## Psychology

### Focus
- Neuroscience
- Learning & Memory
- Motivation
- Cognition
- Perception & Sensation

### Tools
- SPSS for statistical analysis when necessary.
- Preferred writing my own scripts for data processing and statistical analysis since it was less cumbersome.

### Experience
- Lab work with *Sprague Dawley* rats as part of a course.
  - Ran various behavioral assessments.
  - Wrote lab reports analyzing those assessments.
- Read and presented neuroscience research papers to the class.
- Researched the origins of human interests for the motivation course I took.
  - Presented my findings to the class in a lecture format.
  - Wrote a term paper on the topic.
